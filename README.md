# React Challenges

> A collection of different challenges written in React. Point of the repo is for the author to have a space to practice different skills/solutions explicitly in React

## Challenges & Descriptions:

- ### Country Capital Game

  - A country/capital guessing game. Each value is rendered as a button which can be clicked. Guessing each pair correctly removes them until a success message pops up. Buttons are colored appropriately depending on their state.

- ### Whack-A-Mole Game
  - A whack-a-mole game. Each mole is rendered as a div which can be clicked. An interval is set in which the mole pops out and then hides. Clicking on it whilst it's shown increases your score. A basic example of useEffect paired with an interval/timeout function to have state change continuously.
